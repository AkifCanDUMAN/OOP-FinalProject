# Project Information
 This project was started by Akif Can DUMAN and Furkan AY in 2021.
 It was made as a project assignment of the Object Oriented Programming course.
 We tried many different designs while developing the project so that it would be
 easy to use by everyone, and in the end we chose a simple and plain design.
